# Isaac - Jetson Orin Nano Robot System

This repository contains the complete software stack for the Isaac robot system running on a Jetson Orin Nano. The system integrates two RealSense cameras with hardware frame sync, a SparkFun Auto pHAT for servo control and IMU, an iRobot Create chassis, and a custom Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model as the primary controller.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository implements and manages:
- **System Setup**: Automated installation of packages, drivers, and dependencies
- **Hardware Integration**: Drivers and configuration for RealSense cameras, SparkFun Auto pHAT (servos and IMU), iRobot Create chassis, and USB microphone
- **VLA Controller**: Custom Vision-Language-Action model for robot control
- **System Monitoring**: Health checks, performance monitoring, and diagnostics
- **Logging Infrastructure**: Centralized logging with future NFS support for shared storage
- **Control Mode Switching**: Safe mode transitions and state management

## 🎯 Configuration-Driven Approach

This repository uses a **configuration-driven** approach for package management:
- All packages are defined in YAML configuration files (`config/system/`)
- Installation scripts read from these configurations
- Easy to add/remove packages without editing scripts
- Single source of truth for all dependencies

See [Package Management Documentation](docs/development/PACKAGE_MANAGEMENT.md) for details.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Simple Setup Workflow

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jetson-orin-nano
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   Or for non-interactive setup with auto-reboot:
   ```bash
   NON_INTERACTIVE=true sudo ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Activate environment**:
   ```bash
   source scripts/utils/env_setup.sh
   ```

3. **Run code**:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch system_monitor system_monitor.launch.py
   ```

The setup script works identically on:
- **Native Jetson hardware**
- **Docker containers**
- **Ubuntu development machines**

See [Development Workflow](docs/development/WORKFLOW.md) for detailed workflow documentation.

### First-Time Jetson Setup

For initial Jetson system setup (after flashing):

```bash
cd ~/src/jetson-orin-nano
sudo ./scripts/system/setup_isaac.sh
sudo reboot
```

Then run the main setup:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Post-Setup Verification

```bash
# Verify hostname
hostname  # Should show "isaac"

# Verify ROS 2
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 --help

# Check system status
./scripts/monitoring/system_health_check.sh
```
